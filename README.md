## Features

1. **Reading and analyzing the reservation file:**
  - Loads and analyzes the `.rps` files containing the week's reservations.
2. **Reservation management:**
  - Allows adding a reservation directly into the file or deleting one through an intuitive interface.
  ```bash
  node bin/cli.js addreservation "Doe"
  ```
3. **Reservation verification:**
  - Retrieves and displays all information about a reservation.
  ```bash
  node bin/cli.js checkreservation "Doe"
  ```
4. **Table verification:**
  - Allows viewing when a table is reserved, along with the associated reservations.
  ```bash
  node bin/cli.js checktable 7
  ```
5. **Generating a file for the calendar:**
  - Generates an `.ical` file based on the name of one or more reservations so that the user can directly add it to their personal calendar.
  ```bash
  node bin/cli.js generateical "Doe" --output "C:\Users\johndoe\Documents\pizza.ics"
  ```
6. **Displays the star pizza:**
